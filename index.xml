      <description>This is my first post.
I wrote this blog using Emacs and Org mode.
I&amp;rsquo;ve used vim for almost two years.
When I first gave emacs a try maybe couple weeks ago, I was hook.
So I decided to switch from vim to emacs instantly.
Now I use it as my main IDE in daily work.
Still in the process of learning to use emacs efficiently.
Elisp, the language used for written emacs extensions, is way more powerful than vimscript.</description>
